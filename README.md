# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Steganography**, allowing users to:
- **Encrypt** a secret message inside an image.
- **Decrypt** the hidden message from the encrypted image.

The encryption process ensures that the message is securely embedded, while the decryption functionality allows retrieval of the original message.

This project is associated with my **internship at IBM, Edunet Foundation**.
