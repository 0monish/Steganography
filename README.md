# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Steganography**, allowing users to:
- **Encrypt** a secret message inside an image.
- **Decrypt** the hidden message from the encrypted image.

The encryption process ensures that the message is securely embedded, while the decryption functionality allows retrieval of the original message.
